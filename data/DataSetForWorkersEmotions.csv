parents.   I regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and I   
had to tolerate him !  The quarrel made my father think that his children   
may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and

insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did  
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other  
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant  
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that  
nothing had happened and smiled I left.  My friend did not  
say anything but just watched me leave.",
